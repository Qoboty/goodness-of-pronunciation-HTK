These shoes fit my feet
Pat put the pot
The fool is full of food
He bought a boat
Her bird knows words
Cod can't code
Boys buy beer
Very violent vampires
the girls have curls
Wait Kate
Her eyes are ice blue
Sherry is like cherries
My comb is in my home
I think it's a good thing
The jet is not here yet
Jerry loves sherry
